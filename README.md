<h2><strong>Project Purpose</strong></h2>
As an analyst, I have been tasked with analyzing transactional data to provide strategic recommendations to a pet shop owner in the USA on how to effectively target customers and areas to increase sales.

<h2><strong>About the dataset</strong></h2>
&#8226; fact_sales.csv contains transactional data <br>
&#8226; dim_customers.csv contains customer data <br>
&#8226; dim_products.csv contains products data <br>
&#8226; state_region_mapping.csv contains data above locations <br>
&#8226; report.pbix is the final report in Power BI

<h2> <strong>RFM Analysis (steps) </strong></h2>
&#8226; Find Recency for each customer. Take as reference date the maximum date. Lower recency values are better <br>
&#8226; Find Frequency for each customer. Count unique number of days of purchases <br>
&#8226; Find Monetary for each customer. Summary of Total Sales. <br>
&#8226; Create RFM scores based on quantiles of distribution. <br>
&#8226; Recency Score. The nearest date gets 3, the furthest 1. <br>
&#8226; Frequency Score. The least frequent gets 1 and the most frequent gets 3 <br>
&#8226; Monetary Score. The least money gets 1, the most money gets 3. <br>
